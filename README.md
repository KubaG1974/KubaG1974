I have experience as a freelancer until 2016. After a break of 6 years, I decided to get back into programming and started an intensive course in 2022 to refresh and develop my skills.

My goal on GitHub is to showcase my programming skills and look for interesting projects to grow as a programmer. I am looking for a place that offers modern and innovative projects and shows understanding and patience towards juniors.
